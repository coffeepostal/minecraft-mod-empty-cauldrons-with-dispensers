# Empty Cauldrons with Dispensers

🎮 A lightweight Minecraft Fabric mod that lets dispensers empty **water**, **lava**, or **powder snow** cauldrons into buckets.  
The filled bucket is dropped into the cauldron space, where vanilla hoppers or players can collect it.

---

## 📋 Features
✅ Dispensers can extract:
- 🪣 Water → Water Bucket  
- 🪣 Lava → Lava Bucket  
- 🪣 Powder Snow → Powder Snow Bucket  

✅ After emptying, the cauldron becomes empty.  
✅ The filled bucket item is spawned in the cauldron space.  
✅ Compatible with vanilla hopper behavior — hoppers below automatically pick up the bucket.  
✅ Works with players nearby just like vanilla dropped items.

## 🧪 How to Use
1️⃣ Place a dispenser facing a **filled cauldron**.  
2️⃣ Load it with empty buckets.  
3️⃣ Power the dispenser (redstone, lever, etc).  
4️⃣ The cauldron is emptied, and a filled bucket appears in the cauldron block.  
5️⃣ If there’s a hopper below → it grabs the bucket.  
6️⃣ Otherwise → the bucket stays there for the player to pick up.
